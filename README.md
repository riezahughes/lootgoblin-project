# THE PLAN

Accounts where you can make loot hordes. You can send a link to people and they can view the current list of treasure. Users can log in and poke and prod the loot in different ways.
You can create different lists for the treasure. It can start with a base pool and then you can move back and forward from different things as neccessary. Maybe assign certain people to have their own special loot list?
The loot will be autogenerated by the room leader. They can choose WHEN things can be dropped into the pool for other players to poke and prod at.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
