The plan:

Accounts where you can make loot hordes. You can send a link to people and they can view the current list of treasure. Users can log in and poke and prod the loot in different ways.
You can create different lists for the treasure. It can start with a base pool and then you can move back and forward from different things as neccessary. Maybe assign certain people to have their own special loot list?
The loot will be autogenerated by the room leader. They can choose WHEN things can be dropped into the pool for other players to poke and prod at.
